# Google Search Console Verification - Added to Code

## ✅ Verification Meta Tag Added

I've added the Google Search Console verification meta tag directly to your code in `app/layout.tsx`.

**What was added:**
```html
<meta
  name="google-site-verification"
  content="AL_dAbT3HMo2JGmN4fEc8t7K_WM8wfIRYQyMJcC0w7w"
/>
```

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - The changes will be automatically deployed when you push to GitHub
   - Or manually deploy if needed

2. **Verify in Google Search Console:**
   - Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
   - Click "Verify" button
   - It should verify immediately (no DNS wait needed!)

3. **After Verification:**
   - Submit your sitemap: `https://www.osamamoussa.co.uk/sitemap.xml`
   - Request indexing for your homepage

## Why This Method is Better:

✅ **No DNS changes needed** - Everything is in code  
✅ **Instant verification** - No waiting for DNS propagation  
✅ **Works with Vercel** - Perfect for your setup  
✅ **Version controlled** - Verification is in your codebase  

The verification meta tag is now in your code and will be live once deployed!
